# ISP Management System - Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ SIMPLEST INSTALLATION (RECOMMENDED)

**Just copy and paste this ONE command:**

\`\`\`bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmuthee9044-rgb/v0-main-project-o6/main/quick-install.sh | bash
\`\`\`

**OR if wget doesn't work, use curl:**

\`\`\`bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmuthee9044-rgb/v0-main-project-o6/main/quick-install.sh | bash
\`\`\`

This single command will:
- âœ… Download the entire project
- âœ… Install PostgreSQL database
- âœ… Install Node.js 20
- âœ… Create database and all tables
- âœ… Install all dependencies
- âœ… Configure everything automatically

**Takes 5-10 minutes. After completion:**

\`\`\`bash
cd isp-system
npm run dev
\`\`\`

Then open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.
