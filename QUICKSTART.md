## Troubleshooting

### "sudo: cannot execute binary file" error:

This is a serious system issue. Try these fixes in order:

**Fix 1: Reinstall sudo (requires root access)**
\`\`\`bash
# Switch to root user
su -

# Reinstall sudo
apt-get update
apt-get install --reinstall sudo

# Make sure sudo is executable
chmod +x /usr/bin/sudo

# Add your user to sudo group
usermod -aG sudo YOUR_USERNAME

# Exit root
exit

# Log out and log back in for changes to take effect
\`\`\`

**Fix 2: Check system architecture**
\`\`\`bash
# Check if you're running the right architecture
uname -m
file /usr/bin/sudo

# If there's a mismatch, you may need to reinstall your OS
\`\`\`

**Fix 3: Use root to install (not recommended for production)**
\`\`\`bash
# Switch to root
su -

# Run installation as root (modify install.sh to skip sudo checks)
cd /path/to/isp-system
bash install.sh
\`\`\`
